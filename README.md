1. Clone the service file.
2. Open the service file in Automator.
3. Save it under the same name or any name you like.
4. Go to System Preferences and in the the Keyboard setting window, select Shortcuts.
5. Select 'Services' in the left-hand side list.
6. On the right, under General category find your the service you just saved and enter the keyboard combination
   you wish to have as a shortcut. (Note: Make sure the shortcut does not interfere with the default shortcuts in Finder Window. I chose (Command + ')).
